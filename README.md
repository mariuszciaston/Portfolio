My portfolio website v1.2 🔥🔥🔥

[Live Demo](https://mariuszciaston.github.io/Portfolio/) :point_left: <br><br>

- The first project is rendered as static HTML (SSG), with placeholders created for the rest and projects rendered when they enter the viewport

- WebP images were added with container-based sizes and PNG/JPG fallbacks

- aria-labels and a meta description were added to improve accessibility

- Inline SVG icons and fonts were added using @font-face

- Delayed Google Analytics (I plan to research Partytown to improve performance by offloading third-party scripts to a web worker)

All of these changes, along with other optimizations, resulted in 4× 100% scores in PageSpeed Insights / Lighthouse for both Mobile and Desktop. Which I am very pleased with. <br><br>
